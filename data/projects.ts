    overview:
      'This project was developed for Ziekenhuis Geel, in collaboration with a group that supports children through creative Lego activities. Their existing workflow relied heavily on manual paperwork, which created inefficiencies and limited scalability. Working in a team of five, we designed and built a modern Angular application that digitized and simplified these processes, with a strong focus on usability and clarity for non-technical users. Out of nine participating teams, our project placed second and was awarded a prize sponsored by dotNET, recognizing both the technical quality and practical impact of our solution.',

      'This project strengthened my ability to collaborate effectively within a team, aligning technical decisions with shared goals and user needs. I gained hands-on experience working in a monorepo setup using Nx, which improved code organization, scalability, and team collaboration. Additionally, we implemented GitHub Actions for CI/CD and deployed the application on Azure, introducing me to modern deployment workflows and cloud-based hosting for the first time.',

    overview:
      'This project focused on developing a chatbot powered by the ChatGPT API and integrated directly into Microsoft Teams. The goal was to design a conversational interface that guides users through a complete bicycle rental flow. I developed a bicycle rental chatbot that allows users to view available bicycle locations, see which bicycles are available at each location, and rent a bicycle directly through the chat interface. All interactions were connected to a backend system, ensuring that rentals and availability were fully synchronized with the database in real time. The chatbot combines AI-driven conversation with structured business logic to deliver a smooth and reliable user experience within Microsoft Teams.',
    realizations:
      'Through this project, I gained hands-on experience working with the ChatGPT API and learned how to integrate AI into a structured, real-world application. I also developed Adaptive Cards for Microsoft Teams, improving the visual clarity and usability of the chatbot by presenting information and actions in a clean, intuitive layout rather than plain text responses.',
